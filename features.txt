Soft deletes:

    When a record is first created, deleted_at is set to NULL, indicating that it has not been deleted.

    When you want to fetch records that are not deleted (i.e., the active records):
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

    What happens when a user is deleted?
        User:
            SET deleted_at to the current timestamp
            UPDATE users SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = [user_id];

        Questions:
            Keep the questions but remove the association with the deleted user
            UPDATE questions SET user_id = NULL WHERE user_id = [user_id];

        Answers:
            Keep the answers but remove the association with the deleted user
            UPDATE answers SET user_id = NULL WHERE user_id = [user_id];

        Topics:
            Keep the topics but remove the association with the deleted user
            UPDATE topics SET user_id = NULL WHERE user_id = [user_id];
            
        User Votes:
            Remove the user's votes
            DELETE FROM user_votes_question WHERE user_id = [user_id];
            DELETE FROM user_votes_answer WHERE user_id = [user_id];

        User Roles:
            Remove the user's roles
            DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = [user_id];

    add sort to questions and answers by created_at and vote_count
