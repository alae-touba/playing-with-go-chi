Soft deletes:

    When a record is first created, deleted_at is set to NULL, indicating that it has not been deleted.

    When you want to fetch records that are not deleted (i.e., the active records):
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

What happens when a user is deleted?
    User:
        SET deleted_at to the current timestamp
        UPDATE users SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = [user_id];

    Questions:
        Keep the questions but remove the association with the deleted user
        UPDATE questions SET user_id = NULL WHERE user_id = [user_id];

    Answers:
        Keep the answers but remove the association with the deleted user
        UPDATE answers SET user_id = NULL WHERE user_id = [user_id];

    Topics:
        Keep the topics but remove the association with the deleted user
        UPDATE topics SET user_id = NULL WHERE user_id = [user_id];
        
    User Votes:
        Remove the user's votes
        DELETE FROM user_votes_question WHERE user_id = [user_id];
        DELETE FROM user_votes_answer WHERE user_id = [user_id];

    User Roles:
        Remove the user's roles
        DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = [user_id];
